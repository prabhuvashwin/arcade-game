## How the game works
  - The start screen displays 3 options - Music on/off, how to play (for instructions), click to play (to start game)
  - The main screen has got a music on/off button, a back button, and a canvas which displays the game arena. Back button will take you back to the start screen
  - The player (you) will be at the start position at the beginning. You need to cross the road without being hit by the enemy bugs to advance to the next level
  - Navigate player using left, right, up, and down arrow keys
